:earth_asia: `Planet safe. These lines will tune your mind to absolute intellect`
============================================================================================
It is very difficult to understand that you are a hypocrite. It is very easy to contradict yourself, going round and round. If you won't travel in a straight line in a jungle you will get lost and die.
If you don't observe the details and follow these steps very carefully, you will not get the results that you want to achieve.

Methods and materials are abundant and can be launched immediately and effectively. 

Don't approach too fast, it may backfire, slow adaptation, not too slow either.
You can't change the world without changing yourself first. and we can change ourselves.

Can't push the change if the alternative is not there, find the alternative first.
Don't make rules that can't be enforced. 
If the executive comes in the way, blow the whistle, through the judiciary.

What we are trying here is to minimize the use of materials that are mined - metal, cement, minerals. As well as inorganic labs made synthetic like plastic. 

:warning: Caution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This information is ideal, so be careful. You are seeing this because I know you can handle it.

The only issue is that this information will make you angry if you see someone spilling ignorance in front of you.
So don't start a fight to prove your point to a stupid person, you won't achieve anything by doing so except wasting your time, because you don't know their background and could be a psychopath.

So, keep wondering, this information may take a few years to completely sync into your mind.

Utensils
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Only unglazed clay and 100 % cast iron(not cast iron alloy, pure no impurities) utensils should be used (blood is made of iron so no issue).
Some companies are selling steel and writing 100% cast iron, check the factory. (companies are putting some unknown oil coating to prevent rust)(iron is prone to rust so must be coated with mustard oil only after washing).

Cooking pots
________________________________________________ 
100% cast iron wok with lid 3L x 1.
Cast iron pot with lid for boiling.
Flat Pan cast iron.

Accessories
________________________________________________ 
Cast iron Mortar and pestle (stone, wooden should be avoided due to breakage).

Neem Wood Board + rolling pin (avoid stone, plastic, metal). (Neem = antibacterial wood)

Knives big + small (wooden handle is recommended), Cutting board (Neem wood) (avoid stone, plastic or metal). 

Dough mixing pot stainless steel.

Strainer for frying = not the wire mesh one because it is hard to clean, the one with holes, don't keep it drained because it is stainless steel, not ideal. and cast iron is not possible.

Natural fiber baskets.
Clay storage jars.
Clay glass. 

** non-stick Teflon(very dangerous), aluminum, steel, stainless steel, copper, plastic, silicone, tin, ceramic, non-stick Teflon utensils should be avoided. 
But why ? because = metals have leaching properties, can enter the central nervous system, aluminum and copper turn to Al2O3 and CuO. ceramic has paint.

Food Packaging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clay and leaf is recommended.

** Plastic packaging should be avoided(aluminum is slightly better than plastic but still it should be avoided). 
```

Cleaner (utensils/hair/body/cloths/teeth) (won't work if exposed to chemicals, use the normal soap)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Neem wood brush - https://www.amazon.in/Origami-Karma-Tooth-Brush-Bristles/dp/B09MLZ2NDH/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2OG0A81Q64JHE&keywords=neem+toothbrush+good&qid=1685100329&sprefix=neem+toothbrush+good%2Caps%2C344&sr=8-5

Teeth cleaning = dried ginger powder, dried amla powder, dried turmeric powder, dried clove powder, raw unrefined sea salt crystals, tulsi.
Mix the above ingredients (no cavity ever)(remember that if you have eaten factory made things like chocolate then this wont work, use toothpaste, it will work but after a few more times). 

Body(cold water) and cloth(hot water) 
________________________________________________ 
Acid wash- lemon/orange/amla juice (squeezing the actual fruit not buying juice bottles from the market). 

Never take a shower bath in hot water, especially head wash, not even in winter. 
If it is too cold then boil the water to 25° Celsius not above.

Base wash - turmeric/neem in hot boiling water(base wash should be avoided in case of clothes specially white color).

Cast iron utensils
________________________________________________ 
Neutral Salt wash - sea salt in hot boiling water

** Vim, rin, surf, tide, soap, shampoo, hand wash should be avoided. (can only be used to clean exposure to chemicals and toxic chemicals like grease, synthetic paint, other chemicals) 

Scrubs
________________________________________________
Body scrub (mini rough textured cotton cloth).
Utensil scrub (coir).

Broomstick(natural fibers)(wooden handle).
Long mop for wet(cloth instead of sponge)(wooden handle).

Cleaning gloves kitchen+bathroom(ok just this one uses plastic).
Toilet brush(wooden handle).
Scrubbing brush with C type handle(coir)(wooden handle).

Microfiber bundle(reuse old fabric).
Garbage bags(don't use these).
paper towel(don't use these).

** Harpic, Lysol, acid, Isopropyl alcohol should be used to remove chemical exposure only.

Pest control
________________________________________________
You have to feed them first at least twice a day, or they will take on their own.

** Garlic, Garam masala, cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, oregano, star anise, bay leaf, curry leaf, mint leaf, Cumin, methi, Kasuri methi should be avoided.

Oil/fat
________________________________________________ 
Cold pressed(not high temperature and pressure pasteurization) mustard oil. (banned by godfather(usa), lift the ban)

Dairy(very difficult to get these, should be avoided) but these are very good and very high in protein. 
________________________________________________ 
Ghee (A2 milk not A1, A1 is GMO cow whereas, A2 is unaltered species)(ghee = butter - fat)
Butter (A2 milk based)(unsalted)
Dahi(Greek yogurt)(sour not sweet)

** Paneer, raw milk should be avoided.
** Non-dairy milk should be avoided like almond milk because it's fake.
** Sunflower, safflower, olive, avocado, rapeseed, palm, vegetable oil should be avoided (expensive slow poisons, increases cholesterol resulting heart attacks, these oils + gym is fatal)

** Apple, strawberry, watermelon, guava, jackfruit, pineapple, litchi, kiwi, raspberry, blueberry etc should be avoided, (Steve jobs died because of this, he didn't know which fruit to eat).

*** Well, the growth in carbon dioxide over the past 100 years has made plants addicted so, the plants now have high sugar levels and decrease in protein but it will level up after the pollution is gone. 
Protein is not necessary for every person except (physical labor) and sugar can be drained by doing exercise so there is no issue.
```

Drinks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Drinks = Lemonade, Fruit juice (Grape, mango, sugarcane, orange), Coconut water.

** All types of supplements(you don't need them = expensive urine), Tea, coffee, health drinks(boost/horlicks), chocolate, redbull(taurine),  cola, soda, lassi, milkshake, aloe vera are dangerous. sugar free is more dangerous than sugar(don't fake your receptors).

Alcohol (decision making ability is affected and leads to poor judgment, enhances the anger) 
________________________________________________
White wine (green grapes)
Rum (sugarcane)
Wheat beer

**Whiskey, vodka, gin, normal beer (barley) , red wine( dark grapes) should be avoided.

Smoke(enhance decision making process, decreases the anger)
________________________________________________
Ganja(Marijuana)/bhang(Cannabis)/hash(raisin) (can cure all diseases, it has no side effects or overdose)(brain has cannabinoid receptors by default)(only sativa species all other are GMO)

Opium (can cure all diseases, but it has overdose so caution is required, that's why the first option is recommended).

Well a disease is an idea, I had a panic attack 4 times well nothing serious. But I made the same mistake 4 times over excitement. The thing is there is a sequence, you can smoke pot first and then drink alcohol and then smoke again if you want. 
But if you drink first and then smoke pot, then you will get a panic attack, well nothing serious just sleep for 1 hr on the spot, everything will get normal, max you will get unconscious.
The reason is THC is stronger than alcohol... That means if you smoke first then alcohol will not have an effect. 
It is like you eat the less sweet first and then the more sweet item, but in this case you should have more sweet(weed) first.

Hemp cigarettes can replace nicotine(hemp has very lower THC than marijuana).(Billion dollar startup idea)

**Never use cigarettes(carcinogenic), e-cigarettes, cocaine and other(these are synthetic, inorganic, lab made, lots of chemicals, fatal).
```

Cooking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Never eat too much at once, eat less but 4 times and if not feeling hungry reduce the previous meal next time.

Cooking time = 15 - 20 minutes MAX, I live at sea level (might need more in few areas like norway or himalayas altitude affects the pressure, population density is low , so no problem).

Procedure
________________________________________________ 
rice/poha, dal and dishes.
________________________________________________ 
Oil(fat) goes first. 
Spices if required.
Veggies or rice or dal.
Add required Water.
Close the lid.
Boil it for 15 min until done, don't open the lid yet.
Fine tuning the technique, after a few rounds you will get the idea.

Other food items = Mustard paste curries, Mango khatta, Dahi vada.

Rice = plain/salty/sweet/pudding.

Pitha(Sanskrit)(Greek = Pita/ roman = pizza)(something stiff = bread). 
Rice or suji pitha = dosa(pan)/idli(steamed)/vada(fried).
Wheat Pitha(Sanskrit) =  roti(baked)/nan(baked)(this one is Italian pizza).
Fried wheat Pitha(Sanskrit) = puri(fried)/luchi(fried).

Sweet Pitha = cakera(Sanskrit) = (cake = sweet pizza) (donuts/pretzel comes in this category). 

Dessert = Peda, Ladoo(boondi/coconut), Gulab jamun, almond barfi.

** Cashew barfi, should be avoided

New born baby
________________________________________________ 
Initially breastfeeding as long as the woman can produce milk.

Just boiled and smashed rice/chuda(poha/flattened rice)(these are carbohydrates very necessary, it is the building block), extra boiled very soft like pudding, but without salt and spices and oil.

Then if the baby has gained some weight then dal(It is protein so check if the baby is ready, and not showing any problem), but still avoid oil and spices.
Then khichdi is a good dish for babies. It is rice and dal mixed and boiled together without salt, oil and spices. 

** Avoid factory made products like lactogen and what not, avoid cow or any other milk, salt, sweet, oil and spice that comes after 5 years of age.

Appliances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
LED Bulb - 4 watts (study room) to 9 watts(outside) enough, golden yellow color light, use white color light outside or bathroom but not living room, bed room, white emits UV, which can damage eyes = 1 USD max(available all around the world).
(Size of the bulb needs to be reduced, and the socket needs to be smaller like 2 pin plugs)

BLDC fan - 30 to 40 watts, BLDC motor fans = 30 USD max(available all around the world).
(Hemp fiber, 2-3 blade, more aerodynamic blades)

Stove - wood fire(clay oven), cast iron hot plate cooker(heating coil inside) powered by solar, not induction cooker(magnetism) = 20 USD max(available all around the world).
(should be made of Clay body)(one power on indicator LED, wifi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Microwave and other ovens - stainless steel and Teflon coating inside, therefore very dangerous.(petroleum gas powered oven very dangerous)

Mixer/ grinder/ juicer = there is a poisonous grease inside the blade bearing therefore avoid these.

Water purifier - Avoid using RO, its equivalent to distilled water used in big batteries and has nothing in it, no minerals. 
Live near rivers, drink direct, well water drink direct(not steady wells/only stream wells), don't dig new wells like every person is boring his own, stop cities live near rivers.
** Avoid drinking from ponds or lakes, these are not flowing water.

1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star = very high consumption, highest bill, lowest efficiency.(Needs to be banned)

5 star = very low consumption, lowest bill, highest efficiency.(Rectifier needs to be removed, well can be sold separately)

Refrigerator(100w) =  200 liters 5 star inverter fridge = 200 USD MAX
(should be made of hemp fiber(outer body) and Clay body(inner body), cylindrical shape)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Ac(400w) = is it really required, 1.5 ton 5 star dual inverter portable ac = 500 USD MAX(available all around the world),(Daikin is the best brand).
(should be made of hemp fiber(outer body) and Clay body(inner cooling chamber), cylindrical shape)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

[https://www.amazon.in/dp/B084LGQKD7/?coliid=I2BFB5UG6QLVLQ&colid=1IDYXFOGSKWFV&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it]
Washing machine(300w) = 8 kg, 5 star inverter automatic with hot water feature, don't buy dryer, or inbuilt dryer(use rare) for rainy days ...sun dry is best  = 300 USD MAX(available all around the world).
(should be made of hemp fiber, cylindrical shape)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Dishwasher(200w) = 5 star inverter = 300 USD MAX(available all around the world).
(should be made of hemp fiber)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

On spot power generation is recommended (transmission lines are very inefficient; more than half the power lost is hysteresis only).
________________________________________________
solar panel = bifacial mono perc [600 w] (life = 25 years) = 150 USD MAX(available all over the world)(might require 2 panels in low sunlight areas like Norway).
(should be made of hemp fiber)

solar charge controller with WiFi phone app = [50 A] (life = depends) = 200 USD MAX(available all over the world).
(should be made of Clay body)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

battery = lead battery[300Ah] (not good but for now until hydrogen fuel cell/electrolyzer is available) (life = 10 years if lucky) = 300 USD MAX(available all over the world).

I don't want any import tax on all hydrogen products, I mean we don't have a single company, how can our market be threatened. Buying petrol from outside, money goes away anyway.
So cut gas purchases by half and buy electrolyzers from Nel_hydrogen. This will cut the Toyota_mirai and Nel_hydrogen electrolyzers price in half.

Not all solar panels are good. The bifacial mono perc solar panel is the latest technology and highest rated 600w generation per panel and highest efficiency 21%. 1 panel per home is enough for most.

I mean don't buy liquid hydrogen from outside, buy the H2 Electrolyzers from like nel hydrogen Norway. We have solar panels here, we just need to connect them.
The import tax on H2 electrolyser and fuel cell is 48%, now who is benefiting from this. I want it to be zero because our industries are very slow and they won't emerge unless we eliminate import tax. Consult RBI also, but I don't think there will be any problem, this is temporary.

Self declared scientists say hydrogen is inefficient, let me tell you something. The weight of 21 liters of H2 is 2 grams, less than the weight of your iPhone battery. You can't charge a battery more than 100% but there is no such thing in hydrogen just get a bigger tank.
Yeah, you can use your phone for a week. Forget about the phone right now, we are too far.

The current efficiency of
Coal/water/wind/nuclear (100 watts input)
Turbine 30w
Step up transformer 15w
Transmission lines 7w(it's even lower than this)
Step down transformer 3w (your wall socket)
Charger 1w
Battery 0.5 w
Inverter 0.25 w
Trust me reality is even worse, just think about the materials involved.
________________________________________________
                  Solar
________________________________________________
Sun rays (100 w input)
Panel 20w
Hydrogen electrolyzer 10w
Fuel cell 5w  (this is your wall socket)

So the 100 w example will be 3 w when it's reaching you, compare that to the solar 5w.

So after doing this, the factories, vehicles, homes will have on spot generated power.

Now the power from existing hydro, wind, solar farm/nuclear should be connected to the Electrolyzer and generate the hydrogen right there.
Transport the hydrogen to the air base by trucks powered by hydrogen. We can directly inject hydrogen into aircraft today.
Just need a few cheap changes in the aircraft like new gauge and connectors. Don't fill excess in the tank, just to reach the destination or a bit extra in case of diversion.
So for intercity use the turboprop aircraft. But state to state and international use turbofan aircraft.
We already have too many hydro power plants, enough to handle aviation in the beginning.

Electronics
________________________________________________ 
Internet = starlink(available)(expensive), oneweb(low price)(wait for launch soon)(no separate dish, cable tv or anything required).
(size needs to be reduced)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Earbuds = jabra elite 3, jabra elite 4, sony. (These have ANC(noise cancellation) features, you have to turn OFF ANC while walking on the road be careful, use ANC only for conference calls)

Bluetooth speaker = apple home pod/alexa echo studio/Sony srs-xb43 for music, phone speakers will be enough in the future, the tech already exists but profit is coming in the way, just need four drivers. 
(size needs to be reduced)(one power on indicator LED, wifi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Phone + tab + PC in one device = Samsung/Microsoft rollable phone (coming soon)(reduction of electronic waste). https://youtu.be/xT9F9eW6mYI
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)

printer = portable thermal printers(this printer doesn't require ink)(not for everyone, save paper).
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)(one power on indicator LED, wifi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)
Well, I try not to use printer, but sometimes it's necessary to memorize the formulas.
Portable thermal printer is maintenance free, I mean there is no ink drama or anything. Well it actually burns the paper very quickly, that's how it works. Well the bill printers are also thermal printers, I just want to end the bill system,well they can sms the receipt why printing.
Well paper is not bio degradable as you are thinking. At least people can't buy holly books anymore.

Ban watches, smartwatches are there.
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)

Security camera = your own country brands, just infrared vision for night, free cloud storage for a week at least for crime detection, but the data center needs to be secure and in the same country. 
(weather, waterproof cameras)(install four in four sides of the house, make sure lights are installed on all sides)= 30 USD/per camera MAX(available all over the world).
(size needs to be reduced)(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Door lock = design change required by replacing steel with carbon fiber or hemp fiber.(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

TV = well TV uses a lot of plastic, portable laser Projector are future = anker capsule 3 and similar.
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)(one power on indicator LED, WiFi controlled over phone app, no other buttons or LCD displays required, reduction of electronic waste)

Automobile
________________________________________________ 
Most people should use e bikes = 400 USD MAX(available all around the world) 
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)

Most people should use mopeds = vespa electrica and equivalent = 1800 USD MAX(available all around the world)
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)

Cheapest EV car available(Citroen e-c3) = 15000 USD MAX(till 2023)(well EV solar charging would require 1 more solar panel addition to above calculation).
(outer body should be made of hemp fiber)

The best car is the Toyota Mirai but it is very expensive right now, because its life span is 100 years, it is called a forever car.(future is green hydrogen fuel cell not "Lithium battery = toxic and can’t be used in aviation").

I don't want Tesla's gigafactory here, bring the toyota mirai instead, well toyota already have production facilities here, obviously battery electric has to stop one day, recycling old battery is a big problem, tesla autopilot is good but not the priority right now.
Don't start digging lithium in Kashmir (only tourism, no factory). But the Gigafactory concept is good, totally solar powered. Enforce all existing factories to use solar.

** A lot of metal parts need to be removed from these appliances and replaced by hemp fiber.
```

Policy change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Infrastructure
________________________________________________ 
Ban public chairs, seats from cement, plastic, stone and metal. By wood only. Stop building statues. Planet doesn't even like a stone to be picked up.
Banning of street lights and poles = solar powered, 20 w LED enough, should be mounted on a tree rather than steel pole. 

Technology upgradation
________________________________________________ 
Now where is the 5G, I live in the biggest city in my state but still using 4G. China is launching 6G. Looks like soon I will be a Chinese slave. 

Lacks semiconductor fab intel, nvidia.

Banning of paper.

Banning of currency notes immediately and digital apps and CBDC are already there. So CBDC for now, but cryptocurrency is the future.
Cryptocurrency hardware wallets = of course, a phone is enough but these are for the people who don't know how to use a phone. Money stays on these, unlike your debit and credit cards which requires the internet.

There are 2 types of digital currency.
1) Central bank digital currency (CBDC) - normal bank circulating digital currency. Transactions are stored on a single bank server.
2) Cryptocurrency (bitcoin/whatnot/it just needs good AI bots to handle customer issues) - decentralized digital currency, no banks, automatic virtual bank. Transactions are stored hidden. There is no single server but too many servers called miners(a general person outsourcing own computer). 
Miners lend their computers to be used and earn for renting the server. Miners can't see the data themselves because it's hidden and random.

The clay artists and over jobs where heat curing is required, the oven power should be solar not wood or coal.

Free phones for the poor.
Banning of fiber optic cables.
No need for capital and cities. 5G and satellite internet is already here. Disperse the crowd. ( new invention required : Oneweb to cellular 5G converter technology doesn't exist)

Food
________________________________________________ 
Wheat, rice, pulses can be bought only. rest grow on your own.

Ban synthetic chemical fertilizers.

Migration
________________________________________________ 
Why are we making concentration camps? There must be more ways but I can only think of one right now, navy ships have large troop carrying capacity and best hospitality of toilet,food, medicine, they operate on long term rate, on old agreements so very cheap, and they have to sail anyway. Take them to their original place. 
Airlines operate at a current rate, very expensive. 
But don't take them right away after identifying or women children will die out of water, hunger and exhaustion. But to a few places you have to send them by airlines, just adjust them in empty seats, slower process but cheap. 

Now to stop them from coming, we have to eliminate currency notes. Our own people who can't use phones are very difficult to find nowadays, anyway they have to use card payment, plus the CBDC is here now, there is no other way. And we have to block their countries' banks from operating here. 
CBDC can work without the internet that means the money stays on each device like Bitcoin but Bitcoin has some more advanced features like it replaces banks all together, it just needs good AI bots to handle customer issues. We can discuss cryptocurrency later, it's a vast topic. 

Now to stop them thinking about leaving their country requires improving their agriculture, arts and culture, and the internet. And we have to send un troops to eliminate the ter,ror,ists, and those sending them bullets(who are the double dealers anyway).
Why are we keeping our jobless wandering on streets doing mischief taking drugs, rather than sending them there to explain culture and arts and judiciary. There is a scarcity of leaders right now, because they have been forced into misery.

Administration
________________________________________________ 
I don't understand how every country has its own constitution whereas the person living there is the same human. There should not be something called citizen rights, there should be the same human rights only for all countries.

The government has no business in business, converting all govt manufacturing and services to private.

Reduction of police muscle and fire and vehicle speed. 
Free speech. Right to information.

Abolition of schools and colleges (sports and art clubs, markets, online apps are enough for meeting and discovering new people already)

We may have to abolish marriage, which doesn't have any significance today. (Court is entering homes while there is no violence yet, 99.9 % of women and children can't access the court in the first place.)
A woman can agree to have a child if she has resources for the entire life. (Nothing else can be enforced.)

LGBT = The population is too high right now, so I don't have a problem, only if they don't make test tube babies, they can adopt I guess. 
No marriage regulation is required. No recognition is required. The right to freedom is already there. 

But Ai will provide security in the coming years, so people can stay single as long as they want so why homo sexuality.

Ban the zoo, go to the jungle if you can.   

Be careful that even small things and negligence can cause a lot of pollution.
Metal cement petroleum and transportation, anything linked to this creates pollution, because these are obtained through mining.

House construction

Land allocation
________________________________________________ 
Satellite imagery land allocation, same for each person.

Every person should get his own room in a family (not a small room, mind needs more room to grow), but smallest bathroom possible. 
(Room size = length - 5 m, breadth - 5 m, height - 4 m, Bathroom size = length - 3 m, breadth - 1 m, height - 4 m, Kitchen size = length - 5 m, breadth - 2 m, height - 4 m)

Area for gardening. Minimize gardening tools(more wood, less metal, less power tools).

Exterior
________________________________________________ 
Never build cement houses(especially those who live near earthquake zones).(We can't increase weight of the place)

Wood and mud combined houses are best and you will be so happy.

Build only the house not floors above, it is very important to escape emergency situations like fire.

Four very tall trees at 4 corners of the house to ground the current in case of lightning. 
Four windows on four walls of the room for natural ventilation and cooling in summer hot weather.

East facing main entrance. (To honor and remember that we are made from the Sun and its light should enter first at sunrise, like the Colosseum, Parthenon, pyramid of Giza, chichen itza.

Ancient structures like Rome and temples of India are made of (lime mortar) . It is a natural Eco-friendly cement made from baked dead sea shells hand picked and collected from the sea shore. (Today's cement = modern cement = CaCO3 is obtained by mining.)

Bricks = baked is a solar powered curing oven.

Ban marble.
Ban metal pipes. (Only this one plastic) 

Electrical wiring
________________________________________________ 
Wiring = 1mm gauge insulated copper wire enough to handle the load, not thicker wires or loss will increase.

Earth wiring = 6ft deep grounding, 3-4 mm gauge uninsulated  copper wire.

The wiring should be done in such a way that the least and shortest length of wire is used to connect every room from the MCB. Don’t create points on every wall, just one wall is enough. 
MCB - Main circuit breaker

Interior
________________________________________________ 
Furniture- minimum furniture, minimum wood design(not heavy) and without paint and polish(chemicals).
Coir mattress only.

Metal screws and nails should be avoided.

Home decors are not Eco friendly.
Wall paints(emulsion) are synthetic.

Ban pencils, clips, pins, pen, clipboard , duct tape .
Ban paper towels.
Ban the books.

Ban room heaters.

Acrylic paints for artworks, canvas from leaf fiber not cloth.
Children's toys are metal, plastic so ban them.
Flower pots = Clay only. (Avoid Plastic, cement, metal, ceramic)

Ban of fences are important - wire, metal, wall, wood should be avoided... Can plant trees only.
```

Mineral mines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Shutdown all types of power plants. Homes in cities can be powered by solar. Just 1 panel is required for one home, already available.

Solar parks are not helpful because there is huge transmission loss. [V = IR][R = p x Length/Area](That means if length increases, resistance increases, if resistance increases voltage and current decreases.)
Every other source is very limited except solar, sunlight is unlimited, so it has to be the only source. Solar panels don't require a sunny day, just morning is enough.

Stop building wind mills.(huge metal use)(huge transmission loss)(natural flow is disrupted)(reaction force(force required to keep it in its place) is very high)
Stop building tidal mills.(huge metal use)(huge transmission loss)(natural flow is disrupted)(reaction force(force required to keep it in its place) is very high)
Stop building hydro power dams.(huge metal use)(huge transmission loss)(natural flow is disrupted)(reaction force(force required to keep it in its place) is very high)

Control of lithium mines. It can't be stopped until hydrogen fuel cells are available.

Stop digging mines = we don't need metals anymore = natural hemp fiber and carbon fiber parts are used now and more efficient and lightweight.

Banning of cement.

Ban glass items.

Collection of existing metal items from common homes to gov offices, except absolute necessary parts like wires, few tools and recycle and store in uniform weight distributed over various safe guarded places across world for future use.

All carbon capturing ideas and what not is a waste of time and money. They are trying to decontaminate by contaminating further. Manufacturing such machines will increase CO2 even more. Why do we need capturing machines if plants are already doing that, we just need to stop producing. 

Recycling facility - solar powered small blast furnace, without battery, only morning operations. 
```

Future of transportation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Stop constructing new roads, bridges, new ports, alternate(EVTOLS) are coming is few years 

Banning of formula 1, motogp. (formula-e is there)
Banning of older vehicles.
Banning of current public transports = reduce vehicle weight and size
Banning of trucks, only air drops for defense equipment.
Banning of trains, track maintenance creating too much pollution because a lot of metal is required.(Stop hyperloop projects around the world, yes elon musk is more like a businessman, he doesn't understand science and technology which most people think)
Banning of trams.
Ban the boats except wood and electric ones.
Army vehicles are not efficient.

Banning of commercial heavy metal shipping vessels, new vessels = natural hemp fiber and carbon fiber + wood + electric propulsion + (solar+wind) combo powered.
Shipment = only technology, important goods not everything, grow food in your country.

How to generate hydrogen at your location
________________________________________________ 
Electrolyzer = if current passed through water, electrolyzer converts water into hydrogen and oxygen 
So the current should be coming from the solar panel. 

https://nelhydrogen.com/water-electrolysers-hydrogen-generators/
https://nelhydrogen.com/hydrogen-fueling-equipment/

*** a smaller compact version is required for domestic home use, to replace dc to ac inverters. 

How to use Hydrogen 
________________________________________________ 
Hydrogen can be directly burnt - if we burn hydrogen it will produce water, this can be used for airplanes or rockets.
But hydrogen can also be used as a battery(H2 fuel cell) , this will also work the same way it will produce current and water, this can be used in cars and bikes... 

https://www.ballard.com/fuel-cell-solutions/fuel-cell-power-products

*** a smaller compact version is required for domestic home use, for replacing inverter toxic lead or lithium batteries.

Space

Hydrogen aircraft.

Intercity
________________________________________________ 
EVTOL Air taxi = hire,  ambulance.

Intracity(But you have said no road, OK wait, elevated surface automatic mud road leveling machine(roller), we just need to level the mud road time to time, like day after the rain)
________________________________________________ 
Moped. (Two wheeler)
Car hire - 100 Km/h max speed (Autopilot car)
Public transport - 80 Km/h max speed (Autopilot mini bus)(tank like wheel bus)(Men/women separate section right side/ left side) 
Heavy transport - only helicopter (Rare use)

Near by
________________________________________________ 
Bicycle, e-scooter.

Software
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Automatic deletion of data = Google, Microsoft, Meta should free up data centers, I mean dead people have accounts today. 1 backup in a data center another should be peer to peer distributed for 6 months.(Like Telegram is giving, auto deletion of account if inactive and not intervened within 6 months)

Product verification before dispatch. (Hide seller id and consumer id if manually checked for certain products) 

Amazon go (automatic shops)(But man women different sections are required) - food items should not be sold online. (Most people are not buying anyway)
Robot - cleaning, washing, cooking.

Pre-set adult content filter by google and all.

Both hardware and software are closed source, not allowing us to see if there is any subroutine that can automatically search the content. (Apple, Microsoft, google, meta)
But Android is open source so we can see what's inside... And it's very good, but the other problem is that it is forcing us to use google's other services that are closed source. They are not letting us see inside the source code. 
For example Linux is open source and used by all servers. This is very good.

Closed source (spying)  | Open source (Very safe)     
------------------------|----------------------------
Whatsapp                | Signal     
     
So tell them to open source fast or shutdown we don't need these.(Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta)

You people have lot of misconceptions about hacking, well it's just a fancy made up word. If I can access your facebook profile or see inside your computer then you say you were hacked. But now a days both hardware and software have become powerful and secure. Which means the firewall has improved a lot, because it's also a software.
So to hack your Facebook account I need your password, because it is impossible to hack Facebook server. Then how can I know your password, there are only five ways.
If you wrote your password somewhere and I got it.
If you are sleeping some where and someone looked into your device.
And If you are using wifi outside like hotel, shop, airport etc.
If I am staying near your house and got signal from your router(fiber modem).
So someone must be near you to do such things.
Yes, if you are using your phone network 5g/4g then you are safe. Of course you need fiber internet, so you have to set the router password to very difficult. Not talking about wifi password, your router has a separate password.
When you buy fiber service, when they provide you the modem, there is a link, user-name and password written on the box, so don't throw away the box right away. Go to the link, enter user-name password and set a difficult password.
Don't buy too powerful modem like big antennas and more range, you just need signal inside 2 rooms that's it.

Open source Software        
________________________________________________ 
Laptop/Phone/tablet

Browser = Chrome, Firefox, Brave
Office = LibreOffice
Vpn = Psiphon
Pdf viewer = sumatra
Image editor = Gimp
Vector graphics = Inkscape
Video player = Vlc
Cache cleaner = Ccleaner
Compressor = 7-Zip

These 2 tools are very powerful for editing text files. the main git file will become lengthy day by day then it will be more difficult to search. 

1) https://meldmerge.org/ (This is like git but offline to compare changes in text files.) 

2) https://code.visualstudio.com/ (This is a text editor, don't be afraid of the name, it's easy to use, just install, when you click on find and input a word or line, you will see the search results with better experience.)
The only issue with this software is that it doesn't have a dictionary. So you have to copy paste it to the normal google word type office software to correct spelling and grammar.

I use Asus vivobook x510uf , intel i5, 12 gb ram, 2gb NVIDIA graphics card, 250gb ssd. (550 USD, I bought it online on valentines day offer, will be more cheaper on Halloween) 
These above tools will run smoothly on any Apple laptop, if you don't know how to buy a Windows laptop. Yeah, buying a Windows laptop is very tricky. Shops will cheat you and you don't know how to order online.
I make software. I need a laptop for now. But you should buy an Apple iPad or Samsung galaxy z fold 4 instead of a laptop.
Galaxy z fold is best right now because It combines, phone, tablet and laptop into one device. Of course rollable will be better in the future. But the z fold is the 4th generation now and cheaper than iPhone, iPad, macbook combined.

https://www.synthesia.io/
https://www.descript.com/
If you want to become a Director and can't afford Warner Bros or Columbia Pictures, you can use these. Free software is not available right now, but will be available after 1 year. These are very new right now. Don't upload yourself into this.

Well, jobs will be different in the future. I have been developing Ai since 2017, and in 2012 I figured that people are very stupid and moving in the wrong direction. Don't worry Ai will take most jobs but still, I beat AI every day. 
Ai can't create something new, It can only use the data that already exists. The only issue is China, I really don't know what they are up to. I can't see what is happening inside China. 

https://alternativeto.net/ (Alternativeto is a good website to compare software and find Android equivalent software for Apple or vice versa. Or to find free open-source software.) 
Just don't be very happy, be careful, and don't download unnecessary software. Verify the software links before downloading.

I have used https://www.udemy.com/ a lot. It gives you the power to learn any course for 5 USD, can you imagine. Again 5 USD during offers, Halloween is the lowest price. Compare different courses and Watch the course demo videos before buying.

Grievance redress mechanism (This software is very easy to make, can be made within a day. Give the contract to Google.)
________________________________________________ 
Create an issue. (automatic routing to respective department) 
Solve issues. (within 24 hrs) 

If recreated. (if unsatisfactory) 
Inform top level. (auto upgrade) 

If not solved within 24 hrs. (auto deduction of salary from department head to victim) 

Court reforms
________________________________________________ 
Banning the jury system in courts. we have to put one judge to be responsible. Digital e-courts except the criminal court.
Legal battle needs to be free and smooth, self representation. Simplification of case file(only digital). 
Allow AI to access the courts database.

Electoral reforms
________________________________________________ 
Digital election, voting from registered phone numbers.

Citizen Id
________________________________________________ 
I mean what nonsense, biometric id, voter id, tax id, passport id, driving id, health id but still no facility. (Keep one number only)

Facts
________________________________________________ 
You might be thinking that open AI, spacex are highly intelligent people working there. Well, you don't know anything.

Chat Gpt is just a GUI, they haven't made the core software technology, like I have my own. It's just too easy to make, it's just using statistics. Open ai just made the graphical user interface and leased a cloud space from their investor Microsoft Azure. 
That's it, I can launch my own tomorrow, I just need a cloud subscription like AWS(you can buy it online, takes 1 day for verification, but costs a fortune). So if a data center is required, then it can be turned off by just 1 switch.
AI is not working because of software, this software was created way back, and it is launched now because they need high-power chips(cloud data centers) which were not there before.

So who created AI software, or reverse-landing rockets?

Well, it is developed by an open source community from people all around the world, they are very good people, they don't have money, they don't work for any company, they just work for the betterment of society, that's all they want.
They receive donations from people, 1 USD, 5 USD, 50 USD like that. And these people are very weak. That's why they don't work in big companies where they face harassment, they will take your idea and fire you, like they fired Steve Jobs.

So, the robot army type technology exists but is not that good now, the power source like batteries is very limited. Even though you can see the problems in chat Gpt, I mean for me it is not that good today. I mean it could be good if you buy a premium cloud, but not for free.
So when will it be good, the chip in your phone is a 7nm transistor, and today 3nm can be manufactured? And 1 nm is last because that is the size of the silicon atom.
What then? There are attempts to build a quantum computer like google quantum computer. Everything will be the same as manufacturing, just different materials will be used in making that chip.
After this, computers will have more power. Right now its brain is not even as good as a rat's mind.

How to use computer/phone  
Do not use # tags, Don't use third party filters, you can edit by phone default, Don't use unverified apps.

Don't save anything on your phone/laptop/tab other than movies,songs, it doesn't get deleted even if you go to the recycle bin and delete it. Because there is crash protection software by default and you can't change this setting, it's locked on every device in the world. . . 
It can be recovered very easily, that's why you are not safe in the service center

If you move a photo to another device, it is still not deleted, so you will think that memory will get full, so the old deleted data will be permanently deleted if memory gets full by new data Overriding. Until the new data is full, the previously deleted data will remain hidden.
If you choose a quick format an internal drive/Pen Drive/external hard disk. Data will not be removed. So you have to uncheck the quick format option, so that deep format will run, so only after a deep format will everything be erased. 

So how to download, when you download it asks where to save, there you have to select memory card in case of phone, and Pen drive like 32gb, use low memory, work on it, upload it to the cloud drive(you can permanently delete data in cloud), then deep format the memory card.
```

Media
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Best picture and sound quality = BBC, Warner bros, Nolan, Tom cruise, Marvel studios.

News
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't read papers. (Too slow)
I don't read magazines. (Too slow)

BBC = too slow, too much pro govt, propaganda.
Deutsche Welle = propaganda.
China = 
Al Jazeera = Arabic channel without a single Arab (this is propaganda)

Limitations = 

Too much content about stupid politicians, 5% about reforms.
Too many posts overall.
Not brief, not precise.

Technology limitations = Not using right tools.

Camera = Sony alpha 1($5000) (This is a mirrorless camera with autofocus 8K res, it is a low light technology, does not require light) (Live streaming require Sony's proprietary software on an intel i9 laptop with NVIDIA)
Gimbal = Freefly Movi Pro($3,995)

Microphone = Sony DWX Digital Wireless

Conference = Sony PCS-XG100
Background Screens = Sony ZRD-2 Video Wall
TV = Sony bravia 4K/8K

Graphics = Lacks vector graphics, Lacks organic theme too much factory made
Logo = Lack of vector graphics, Not organic looking, only 2 colors should be used and small letters, off color like off white, off blue.

Studio = Not classic, not organic looking, no wooden furniture, too much white light like an operation theater.
```

Miscellaneous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Ban concerts. Ban stadiums. Ban large gatherings.

Ban religion.
Ban on coffins.

How to process a dead body = remove the required organs and donate to organ banks, those who want to bury without the coffin and the cement block they used to build on it,  let them do that, they have free will. (or the enemies will pee on it after getting drunk)
But the best way is to put the bodies in a solar powered shredder and mix it with desert sand to manufacture organic manure for agriculture. (No, I am not cruel yet)

Ban Christmas tree, Halloween pumpkin.(This is madness, I mean few leaves enough but not the whole tree)(This is pre christian tradition)
Makar sun-kranti-mas(Sanskrit) = [occasion marks the transition of the sun from constellation Sagittarius (Dhanu) to Capricorn (Makara)]
Kranti = transition(English), mas = month(English).

Halo-eve(This is pre christian tradition)
Aluo(Sanskrit) = Lamp/light(English). 
Dipa-balee(Diwali)(Sanskrit) = Prince Rama returned home after victory, rescuing his kidnapped wife. Rama = roma(Italy) = romance
Dipa = butter lamp(English), balee(Sanskrit) = sacrifice(English)
Aluo(Sanskrit)-balee(Sanskrit) = Lamp/light(English)-sacrifice(English)

So many things not to do, so what should we do = decision making, learn, observe, art, culture(sports, dance, music, movies) , exploration, tourism that's where you should focus on.

All jobs like law, software engineering will be taken by AI, so we don't need more engineers and doctors.

Well I have seen around 500 movies. These are the best of the best. I am sad I lost my backup hard disk drive last October I think. I know I am a software engineer but what can I say about my negligence. 
Remember that you have to transfer your backup before 6 years to a new drive. The lifespan of a hard disk is 6-7 years MAX. 
Now the latest technology is NVME drives.
